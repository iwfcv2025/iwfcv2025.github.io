            <p>
            <li>The paper must be a full paper (12-15 pages) that contains original research that has neither been published nor submitted 
                for publication elsewhere.</li>
            <li>When submitting a paper, the authors should indicate their intention to include the paper in the post-workshop proceedings.</li>
            <p>
                <li>In addition, in order for a paper to be included in the post-workshop proceedings</li>
                <li>It must be presented at the workshop by at least one author.</li>
            </p>
            <li>When submitting a camera-ready version, the authors should complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form to 
                transfer the copyright for the paper to the publisher.</li>
            </p>

            The post-workshop proceedings will be included in Springer Link Digital Library. 
            Workshop attendees will have free access for four weeks after the post-workshop proceedings are published.
            Authors should consult Springer's authors' guidelines (link: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) 
            and 
            use their proceedings templates for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers.
